6/2/2021: Beginning of first HTML/CSS project designed to recreate the Google Homepage from scratch.
6/3/2021: Finished. Very scuffed, top navbar was done using CSS grid where each link had its own id. Bottom navbar was done using ul. But hey, its finished and thats all that matters. If I ever decide to revisit this project in the future, maybe I could implement some Javascript in order to actually accept user input for searches.
